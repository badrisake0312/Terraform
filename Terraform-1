-Statefile-After the deployment is finished terraform creates a state file to keep track of current state of the infrastructure.
          -It will use this file to compare when you deploy/destroy resources, in other words it compares "current state" with "desired state" using this file.
          -A file with a name of "terraform.tfstate" will be created in your working directory.
-Provisioners
-Backends
-Modules
-Data Sources
 If you deploy your resources out of terraform and use them in your terraform code the way you use them through "data sources".
 Data sources in terraform are used to get information about resources external to terraform, and use them to set up your terraform resources.
